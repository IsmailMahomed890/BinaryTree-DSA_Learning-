# Level-Order Traversal Implementation (BFS)

    Level-order traversal visits nodes level by level:
    1. Visit all nodes at depth 0 (root)
    2. Visit all nodes at depth 1 (children of root)
    3. Visit all nodes at depth 2, and so on...
    
    This is useful for:
    - Finding shortest path in unweighted trees
    - Level-by-level processing
    - Tree serialization by levels

# Explanation:
# Level 0: 1 (root)
# Level 1: 2, 3 (children of root)
# Level 2: 4, 5 (children of node 2)
# 
# ðŸŒŸ Key Insight: Uses queue (FIFO) unlike DFS traversals that use recursion stack (LIFO)
