# Binary Trees - Data Structures & Algorithms

A comprehensive collection of binary tree implementations and algorithms to help students understand one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **Basic Binary Tree Structure** - Understanding nodes, left/right children, and tree hierarchy
- **Tree Traversals** - In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals
- **Search Operations** - Finding elements in binary trees
- **Tree Properties** - Height, depth, and tree characteristics
- **Common Algorithms** - Insertion, deletion, and tree manipulation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd BinaryTrees-DSA
   ```

2. Run the examples:
   ```bash
   python BinaryTree.py
   ```
